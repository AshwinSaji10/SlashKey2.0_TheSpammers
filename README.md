Problem : E-commerce Credibility Detection
We worked on an application that checks the reviews of a product listed for sale on an e-commerce platform, to detect whether it is a fraudulently listing, or if it is genuine, if so, it checks for its credibility as well. This would be implemented by two separate machine learning algorithms using sentiment analysis.
